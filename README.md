# LISA Response (on JAX)

This repository contains the code for the LISA response on JAX. 
All the code has been adapted from Mike Katz's cupy [repository](https://github.com/mikekatz04/lisa-on-gpu).

This might be a nice code for those who want to try out gradient-based samplers for LISA data.

Additionally, as JAX is both CPU and GPU compatible, its slightly easier to test (for me as I dont have easy local access to NVIDIA GPUs... Lame).


```bash
pip install lisa-reponse-jax
```
